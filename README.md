# BluettiLib
BluetoothLibrary for Bluetti AC200
This work is based on https://github.com/mariolukas/Bluetti_ESP32_Bridge 
I want to control the Bluetti by an web-Interface and so I try to split Bluetooth and MQTT. This library should contain only the Bluetooth part.

In the moment it does work only with NimBLE-Arduino 1.4.0 not with version 1.4.1
